# EventClocker McClockyFace Deluxe

EventClocker McClockyFace Deluxe is a web widget for an analogue clock that displays today's events from a delimiter-separated txt fle as arcs in the clockface. It can also display a list of upcoming and ongoing events.

It is probably best suited for daily or weekly reoccurring events, but can also be used with dates.

I.e. it takes your data like this:
```
daily 11:00-11:30;       #393;   Daily morning meeting
daily 11:30-12:00;       #993;   Lunch
mon-fri 10:00-18:20;     #933;   Helsinki stock exchange open
mon-fri 16:30-00:00;     -;      NYSE open
mon 18:00-19:00;         #99f;   Sunday sauna
2021-06-23 20:00-21:00;  -;      Some one-time event
2021-06-24 13:00-14:00;  -;      Doctor
``` 

...and turns it into this:

...or perhaps into something like this:
![White McClockyFace](https://storage.googleapis.com/olaviinha/github/clocker/white.jpg)
